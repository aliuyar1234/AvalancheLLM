# RELATED WORK MAP

A Neuronal avalanches
- beggs2003neuronal: avalanche distributions and branching parameter near one in cortical recordings.

B Statistical rigor
- clauset2009power: principled power law fitting and model comparison.
- touboul2010can: warns that thresholding and log plots can create spurious apparent scaling; motivates strong controls.

E Transformer activation phenomena
- sun2024massive: outlier activation phenomenon in LLMs; we study cascade connectivity instead of static outliers.
